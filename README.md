# Little Otter Health

Create a website that visualizes the data at https://lo-interview.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/health_sessions.json. The website should have views that enable the following:

## Day-by-day overview: 

For a selected day, show a simple snapshot of the following data:

- number of sessions

- average length of session

- average distance traveled by patient

- average age of patient

## Distributions of session timing

- distribution of session start time throughout a 24 hour day

- distribution of session end time throughout a 24 hour day

- distribution of session duration

## Choose your own adventure - show us something interesting about the trips

This is open ended!

We’d like the interviewee to demonstrate their own creativity when coming up with what they want to show us

Pretend like you work at the LittleKoala health company and create a view that could be used to improve their services or leveraged for value
